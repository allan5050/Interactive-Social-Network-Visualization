# Interactive Social Network Visualization

This project demonstrates an interactive visualization of a social network using D3.js. As a Technical Product Manager with expertise in data visualization and web development, I created this tool to showcase complex network relationships in an intuitive and engaging manner.

Here is a live-demo version which you can interact with (click the pink "Click here to begin!" button): https://allan28782.gitlab.io/user_graph/

## Project Overview

This visualization represents a Facebook user's friend network, highlighting the interplay between natural friend clusters and user-defined friend lists. Key features include:

- Force-directed graph layout for natural clustering
- Color-coded nodes representing user-defined friend lists
- Interactive elements for exploring network relationships
- Narrative-driven introduction with annotations
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Key Features

- **D3.js Visualization**: Utilizes D3.js for creating a force-directed graph layout.
- **Interactive Elements**: Allows users to hover over and drag nodes to explore relationships.
- **Narrative Introduction**: Guides users through key insights with annotated scenes.
- **Dynamic Legend**: Highlights specific friend lists on interaction.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes for optimal viewing.

## Technologies Used

- D3.js for data visualization
- HTML5 and CSS3 for structure and styling
- JavaScript for interactivity and data manipulation
- GitLab CI/CD for continuous deployment

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
3. Follow the narrative introduction or skip to explore the network freely

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file
- `style.css`: CSS styles for the visualization
- `data.json` and `nodes.json`: Data files for the social network
- `d3.v5.min.js` and `d3-annotation.min.js`: D3.js libraries
- `.gitlab-ci.yml`: GitLab CI/CD configuration

## Future Enhancements

- Implement data input functionality for custom network visualization
- Add more advanced network analysis features (e.g., centrality measures)
- Develop a back-end API for dynamic data retrieval
- Create additional visualization types (e.g., hierarchical, radial)
